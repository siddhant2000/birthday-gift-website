## How to use and customize?
If you are ready to customize this website for your love, then all you have to do is replace the demo images with your own images, make some changes in code and you are ready to go.

1. ### Step 1: Replace the Images
You can find images of each section in image folder. This folder is divided into sections, where each section contain image of 1 section of website.

For example: To replace background and image of section 1  (The opening page), go to
    
        images/section01
replace demo images with you own images, repeat this step for all section.

2. ### Step 2: Edit Timer of first page 
    1. Go to scripts/index.js
    2. Replace date with the date you meet.
            
            const date = new Date(2017, 3, 27).getTime();

And that's all. Give it some personal touch and surprise someone.
